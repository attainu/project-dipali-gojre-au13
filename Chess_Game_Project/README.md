# Chess Game using OOPS concept in Python

By Using Tkinter Gui code i designed chess game and included oops concept inside that. 

I hope you enjoyed the chess for two player can play that game.

In this project i took the code for the chess game tkinter GUI from the @ javatpoint.com and made it compatible with oops concept.

# Problem statement :
I have to design simple chess games. Chess is actually a very popular game. I have to read more about it online on wikipedia or on some other places.

Created 8 * 8 Board

# Entities :
If you have already played it already then you might already know this. But to ensure that we all are on the same page, I am defining some here:
* Board: Board is the one entity representing an actual board on which you play this game.
* Cell: A board consists of a grid of cells.
* Player: Someone who is actually playing right.
* Piece: There are various types of pieces as explained below.

The most importannt things to do in that is Pieces and their moves:

 There are 6 pieces in chess game

 Pawns :

Normally move forward one space. Move diagonal one space to kill. May move two spaces forward on the first move. But may be killed En Passant after this move by attacking the space behind the pawn. May be exchanged for any piece except a King by reaching the opposite side of the board.

Bishops :

Move diagonally any distance. Kill by landing on a space occupied by an opponent's piece..

Knights :

Move in "L" shape (one space one direction, two in a perpendicular direction). May go "over" other pieces. Kill by landing on a space occupied by an opponent's piece.

Rooks :

Move horizontally or vertically any distance. Kill by landing on a space occupied by an opponent's piece. May "castle" with the king under certain circumstances (see below).

Queens :

Move any distance horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Kill by landing on a space occupied by an opponent's piece.

Kings :

Move one space horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Kill by landing on a space occupied by an opponent's piece. May "castle" with a rook under certain circumstances.

The game is over:

when the opponent's king cannot escape being taken check(i.e. Checkmate). or one player can make no move without putting his/her king in danger (i.e. Stalemate)


For run the project by using
